# JPACRUDProject - NES

### Description
A Java based program that creates a database for Nintendo Games.  The user can add and delete games, however, I didnt get the update games to work.

The adding of the game works as well as the delete.

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java

Hibernate, Spring Boot, Gradle, MySql, MySQLWorkbench

### Lessons Learned

I am behind in my studies and had to get extra help just to get started.  I was able to get my add and delete methods working, but couldnt get my update method to work.  I am having a lot of problems with mapping.  I found some help with mapping and if I had to do this project again I could finish it in a day.  I just found the help a little to late.  I went through a tutorial that basically does this same project but with a customer database.  I followed as best as I could but could not get the update method to work.  They were also using some things that I am unfamiliar with and didnt set up my project for.  They were using session when we were using entity manager.

I keep feeling like I am a failure but I know that ultimately I will be successful.  It might take me another two or three months after the program until I feel like I am actually on par with my classmates and what is expected of me.  Right now I am just far behind, and I want to quit.
